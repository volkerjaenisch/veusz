Whitepaper : Veusz modular import dialog plugins TODO: Find better name.

Vuesz features a plugin system for generic import dialogs. This feature was not designed
to allow for writing import dialogs for complex data formats like netCDF oder HDF5.

The idea of "Veusz modular import dialog plugins" is to build a 
plugin system that allows programmers to extend Veusz by complex import dialogs
which may come with a custom QT-design, without changing the code of veusz.

Strating Point:
=============== 
The components of a single import dialog are spread over the following files:
- dialogs/importdialog.py
- dokument/importparams.py
- dokument/linked.py
- dokument/operations.py
- dokument/simpleread.py


Project steps:
==============
To achieve the goal of a new plugin structure the following steps have to be done:
1 Proove of Concept: Isolation of the code for the standard import dialog into a seperate code structure
2 Review of the new code structure by jeremy
3 Migration of all import dialogs into the new code structure
4 Analysis of the outcome and problems  
5 Design of an API for the creation of import dialogs to decouple the plugin code from core code
6 Integrate the import dialogs into the new API

Current status:
===============
Steps 1 and 2 have been done and no problems have occured that may stand against the 
current project idea.
